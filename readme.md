# OurMovies

![Alt text](</public/OurMovies Screengrab.png>)

OurMovies is a movie tracking application where a user can log movies they've seen and/or movies they've yet to see. Addtionally, the user will be able to log their reviews of movies they've seen. This application is connected to [TheMovieDatabase](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) via an API. This way, the user does not have to manually add the information regarding their movie selections which allows for a more seemless experience. 

I chose to build this application for my Unit 2 project so that my partner and I could have a way to log the movies we will watch together throughout 2024. Additionally, I was very interested in practicing with API's and Data.
